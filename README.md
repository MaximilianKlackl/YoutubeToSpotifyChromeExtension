# Spotify to Youtube Chrome Extension

## Description

Chrome Extensions which parses the current Youtube Song Title and add it via the Spotify Api to your playlist

## What I learned

* creating a Chrome Extension
* using chrome extension api for communicating between scripts
* using Spotify Api 
* Oauth flow and authentification

## Installation

1. Download / Clone Project
1. Goto chrome://extensions/
1. enable developer mode in the top right
1. click "load unpacked" button top left
1. select Extension from Folder 
1. authorize your spoitfy and use the service

### Disclamer

Extensions doesn't find every song / my regex is not perfect for parsing the title
